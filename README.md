EP-Dev Whois
===========

EP-Dev Whois is a whois php script that has a multitude of features. 
It  will act as an ordinary whois script, returning whois information  
natively on about 200 different extensions with the ability to easily 
add more. It will also act as a whois script for registrars who plan to 
pass available domains into a billing system for a customer to order. 
These two modes contain a many of features: price table, automatic 
alternative domain searches, ability to pass the full domain and/or 
extension (tld) to another script, backup nameservers, domain search 
logging, multiple extension (tld) searches as one time, query limit 
bypass, custom keyword and query formats for each nameserver, 
enable/disable nameservers and/or extensions, custom currency support, 
and much more. All of the configuration can be edited from within 
control panel. Fully template driven, allowing for one to easily edit 
almost every element of the display to fit any website.
